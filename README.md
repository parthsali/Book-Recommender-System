# Book Recommender System

### The book recommender system web app is a basic project that is built using React JS and Flask, along with the Python libraries NumPy and Pandas for machine learning. 
- The front end of the app is built using React JS, which allows for a dynamic and responsive user interface. 
- The backend is powered by Flask, a Python-based micro-framework, which enables the server to handle data processing and provide recommendations. 
- The app uses collaborative filtering, a type of recommendation algorithm, to generate book recommendations for users. The app collects user data, such as reading history, favorite genres, and ratings of books, to generate recommendations.
